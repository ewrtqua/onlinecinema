                        looking for an assistant who should look after him. One of the candidates, black Driss, is not
                        interested in the job - he needs a formal written refusal in order to continue to receive
                        unemployment benefits. But unexpectedly, it is Philip who hires him....

                        the Public Security Bureau (PSB), led by Makima, who convince him to join their ranks.

                        Due
                        to his dislike of sports, he constantly avoids the school's track and field team, despite

                        hangs
                        out with the upperclassmen in it, and leaves school at exactly 5:00 pm to visit his
                        grandfather
                        Vasuke Itadori in the hospital. On his deathbed, his grandfather leaves Yuuji two orders:
                        "Always help people" and "Die surrounded by people." After his death, the teenager reduces
                        them
                        to one for himself: each person must "die with dignity."
